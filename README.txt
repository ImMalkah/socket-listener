Thank you for reviewing my assignment!

Some general points:
- if connecting to the server from a browser, please use Google Chrome. For some reason,
  Firefox and Safari have some extra authentication that kills the connection.
- if connecting to the server from a terminal, everything will work perfectly and the
  the downloaded file will be saved in the same directory (so basically overwritten with the same information).
  I did it this way because I was unsure if I should do it this way or have it written to a new file appended by
  some other text
  - for example, requesting 'file.txt' would be downloaded as 'file_downloaded.txt'
